Installation and basic configuration
====================================
 *for more details please see the handbook at http://drupal.org/node/328429

_Installing:
If you're reading this, you most likely have the module downloaded. Make sure it
is in you {drupal_root}/modules/activity or more *highly recommended*
{drupal_root}/sites/all/modules/contrib/activity.

_Enabling:
Go to {your_site}/admin/build/modules and enable Activity, and the Core Trigger
modules.

_Configuring your activity action:
Go to {your_site}/admin/settings/actions, click the dropdown to "Make a new
advanced action available" and choose "Record an activity". Click the "Create"
button.

Think about what kind of activity you would like to record and edit the
"Description" field to reflect what the action is meant to do. For example, if
you would like to record an activity every time someone updates a node, you
might enter something like "Record a node update activity".

Next you want to choose a format for your messages using the tokens that are
available.

The *Author message* is how the message is going to be formatted for the author
of this particular activity. So corresponding to our previous example, you might
enter something like "You updated [node-title-link]."

The *Public message* is how the message is going to be formatter for everyone
*other* than the author of this particular activity. So you would want to enter
something like "[user-name-link] updated [node-title-link]."

_Assigning your new activity action to a trigger:
Go to {your_site}/admin/build/trigger/node, click the dropdown to "Choose an
action" inside of "Trigger: After saving an updated post". Click the "Assign"
button.

_Conclusion:
Now anytime an existing node is updated it will record an activity.

_Displaying your activity:
Display is done completely through Views 2, so make sure you have this module
installed and enabled following the same proceedure you used to install and
enable the Activity module.

Activity ships with a default view, so as soon as you go to
{your_site}/admin/build/views you will see a "Default Activity view: activity".
This serves as a basic example of how you can display your activity and can be
customized to suit your needs.
